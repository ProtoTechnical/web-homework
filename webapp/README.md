## TransactionBase - My Divvy Homework Submission
Using the objectives and instructions as a guide, I have developed a transaction tracking software called TransactionBase. These are the four objectives I accomplished through development.

 - Write a basic user interface that allows users to enter, edit, and remove transactions.
 - Provide a pie chart or histogram of the spend per category.
 - Create a user setting that can convert the displayed numbers to Roman Numerals.
 - Add an i18n setting.

In addition to these objectives, I also produced an assortment of unit tests and made sure to use emotion styling.
 
Here is a collection of screenshots showcasing my application.

The transaction table, populated with several entries.
![Adding a Transaction](images/Adding a Transaction.png)
Clicking the Add Transaction button will open a modal where a user can create a transaction. Clicking the edit button of a transaction opens a similar modal.
![Deleting a Transaction](images/Deleting a transaction.png)
Clicking a transaction's delete button will open this modal, asking the user for confirmation before removing the transaction from the database.
![Spending Pie Chart](images/Spending chart.png)
This page displays a pie chart showing spending by category. A user can hover over a slice of the pie chart to access a tooltip displaying information about that slice.
![Settings Page Roman Numerals](images/Settings Page Roman Numerals.png)
This is the settings page that contains two features. The first feature turns all of the numbers on the site (not including numbers that are part of strings) into Roman Numerals.
![Settings Page i18n](images/Settings Page i18n)
The second feature turns every string on the site into Japanese, non latin characters.
